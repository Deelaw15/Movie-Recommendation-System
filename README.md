# Movie-Recommendation-System
This movie recommendation system focuses on four innovative approaches: 
. First, it uses mood-based recommendations that ask users how they're feeling, their mental energy level, and viewing context, then maps these to movie characteristics⁠.
. Second, it addresses decision paralysis through quick quizzes, a "Feeling Lucky" button, interactive filtering, and vibe matching⁠
⁠. Third, it considers context like time of day, available viewing time, and whether users want comfort rewatches or new discoveries⁠
⁠. Finally, it provides transparent explanations for each recommendation, detailing why a film was suggested with specific reasons and confidence scores⁠
